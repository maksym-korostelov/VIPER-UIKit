Application Overview
Functionality: A simple app that fetches a list of users from a mock API and displays their names in a list. When a user taps on a name, the app navigates to a detail view showing more information.

Key Objectives:

Implement the VIPER architecture in both UIKit and SwiftUI.
Highlight the differences in how VIPER components interact in each framework.
Focus on the View, Presenter, and Router to show the most significant contrasts.
